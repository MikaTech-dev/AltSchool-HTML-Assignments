      <!-- A little something about me-->
      <p>
        Hello, My name is Ikenna, I'm 17 years old and I've just graduated secondary school. I'm
        an aspiring Tech Start-up 
        <br />
        CEO, Aspiring Developer, Beginner Programmer and Tech Enthusiast. My goal is
        to make tech more accessible
        <br />
        to the world in it's entirety.
        <br />
        I aim to acquire enough wealth to better my surroundings, and by
        extension humanity as a whole. A bit overly
        <br />
        ambitious and na√Øve I know. But since no one will do it, I'll do it
        myself

      <h2 id="reasons">Why I joined Altschool</h2>
      <p>
        The reasons why I joined Altschool's School of Engineering program were:
      </p>
      <!-- Ordered list to numerate my reasons -->
      <ol>
        <li>
          I believe I require much more knowledge on programming as
          <br />
          a whole than what little I know
        </li>
        <li>I wanted to explore more learning opportunities</li>
        <li>
          I reckon a diploma from altschool along with the certificates
          <br />
          we might get along the way as well as the things we're being
          <br />
          taught would help me populate my portfolio thus giving me
          <br />
          a better chance at getting into the tech industry.
        </li>
      </ol>
